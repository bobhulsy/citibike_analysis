# citibike_analysis
My goal for this project was to see a full year of data to analyze the impact of seasonality and tourism, and to better understand the community partnership between New York and Citibike.
I also wanted to assure that objects like date/time and lat/long were properly formatted for tableau. 
Besides, I discovered some missing objects, and I wanted to make sure duration and distance were included in the new data.

With the haversine formula I was able to assure the lat and lng would provide the variables I wanted, and was curious about why city bike only recently removed them from the provided dataset.

The Tableau notebook can be found in my tableau public repository: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bob.hulsy/vizzes
